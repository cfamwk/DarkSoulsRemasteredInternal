A trainer i wrote for DarkSouls Remastered back when it was released.

It has speedhack, waypoint teleportation, different character effects and other stuff.

the code is not that well written, but it has a pretty sweet ui (a scroll with a blood spill across it)

the code requires LDASM (for calculating instruction size) and DXTK (for rendering text)

cheers!
